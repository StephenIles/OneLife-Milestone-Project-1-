-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   I used [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co) to find a colour palette I felt went well with the design of the website. This is the [Colour Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/3924675d3587a367b1ffd1e3) that I ended up chosing and these will be featured throughout the website.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Oswald and Roboto are the two main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason these fonts are not being imported into the site correctly. Both fonts are clean and commonly used fonts, Oswald is have more of a block type look to is making it ideal for Headers and Titles while Roboto is more rounded and ideal for website text.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
        -   The occupanying imagery to go with each feature is aimed to give the user a quick insite into what the feature is.
        -   On the community page all imagery used is from community members who want to show off their talents.

## Problems and Soultions

### Collapsable Menu on Mobile

One big hurdle I came across was figuring out how to make the navigation bar change to a clickable button which creates a dropdown menu for the navigation only on mobile devices. I knew this was possible using bootstrap but it took a while to figure out how to implement it.

The first step was to figure out how to make the navigation toggle button, which while in the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/) I used this code which worked as the navigation toggle button:

```
<nav class="navbar navbar-dark bg-dark">
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarToggleExternalContent" aria-controls="navbarToggleExternalContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
      <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
    </button>
  </div>
</nav>

```

Once adding this to the end of my header div I needed to add the **collapse** class and **navbarToggleExternalContent** id to the unordered list holding the navigation links.

The next obsticle was to figure out how to have the navigation toggle button only display on smaller screen, and to make the navigation bar only collapse when on smaller screens. 

For this I knew I would have to implement a media query is style.css to change the display property of the **navbar** to none, but my stuggle come from how to make it so that the navbar didn't collapse when in tablet or web view. I did some research using both the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) and this [Stack Overflow Post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74548965/bootstrap-5x-collapse-on-mobile-only) I found that I needed to add the following code in my media query to show all collapsed content on a big screen size

```
.collapse:not(.show) {
        display: block;
        visibility: visible;
    }

```

Once I had to functionality working I had to get the dropdown menu into the correct position, and to do this I made the width of **navbar-nav** to 45%, set the display of all the list items within the navbar to block so they now stack, and then moved the whole navbar to the right and gave it a top offset of 70px to sit just below the header div. Here is the code

```
.navbar-nav {
        width: 40%;
        margin: 0;
        padding:0;
        position: absolute;
        right: 0;
        top: 70px;
    }

    .nav-item {
        display: block;
        text-align: center;
        background-color: #A367B1;
        border: 1px solid white;
        line-height: 50%;
        width:100%;
    }
    
```


### Image Carousel

I knew it was going to be possible to add an Image Carousel with Bootstrap 5 after reading through the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/). I felt this was a nice simple way to showcase different art pieces that have come from the community on the **Our Community Page**. With this in mind I found the following code in the documentation which I used to help build the carousel:

```

<div id="carouselExampleCaptions" class="carousel slide" data-bs-ride="carousel">
  <div class="carousel-indicators">
    <button type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExampleCaptions" data-bs-slide-to="0" class="active" aria-current="true" aria-label="Slide 1"></button>
    <button type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExampleCaptions" data-bs-slide-to="1" aria-label="Slide 2"></button>
    <button type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExampleCaptions" data-bs-slide-to="2" aria-label="Slide 3"></button>
  </div>
  <div class="carousel-inner">
    <div class="carousel-item active">
      <img src="..." class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
      <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
        <h5>First slide label</h5>
        <p>Some representative placeholder content for the first slide.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img src="..." class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
      <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
        <h5>Second slide label</h5>
        <p>Some representative placeholder content for the second slide.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img src="..." class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
      <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
        <h5>Third slide label</h5>
        <p>Some representative placeholder content for the third slide.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <button class="carousel-control-prev" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExampleCaptions" data-bs-slide="prev">
    <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="visually-hidden">Previous</span>
  </button>
  <button class="carousel-control-next" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExampleCaptions" data-bs-slide="next">
    <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="visually-hidden">Next</span>
  </button>
</div>

```

This added everything I wanted from the carousel, the image scrolling function, the Next and Previous arrows, the slide indicator at the bottom and the ability to have a small description with each image to let everyone know who made the art and what the art was about. From the code above I wanted to expand the carousel to have 10 images rather than the 3 by default so for each new image I added an extra section of code, which was: 

```
<div class="carousel-item">
      <img src="..." class="d-block w-100" alt="...">
      <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">
        <h5>Third slide label</h5>
        <p>Some representative placeholder content for the third slide.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

```

Once adding the correct amount of sections I was testing the carousel and noticed that once I got past the third image the next and previous arrows no longer responded. I looked over the code and noticed at the top of the code block there was a line of code that controlled the arrows.

```
<button type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExampleCaptions" data-bs-slide-to="2" aria-label="Slide 3"></button>

```

Once discovering this I added the correct amount of button elements and everything was working correctly with the carousel. My final code the carousel was the follow: 

```
<div id="carouselExampleCaptions" class="carousel slide talent-showcase" data-bs-ride="carousel">
        <div class="carousel-indicators">
          <button type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExampleCaptions" data-bs-slide-to="0" class="active" aria-current="true" aria-label="Slide 1"></button>
          <button type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExampleCaptions" data-bs-slide-to="1" aria-label="Slide 2"></button>
          <button type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExampleCaptions" data-bs-slide-to="2" aria-label="Slide 3"></button>
          <button type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExampleCaptions" data-bs-slide-to="3" aria-label="Slide 4"></button>
          <button type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExampleCaptions" data-bs-slide-to="4" aria-label="Slide 5"></button>
