-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   I used [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co) to find a colour palette I felt went well with the design of the website. This is the [Colour Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/3924675d3587a367b1ffd1e3) that I ended up chosing and these will be featured throughout the website.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Oswald and Roboto are the two main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason these fonts are not being imported into the site correctly. Both fonts are clean and commonly used fonts, Oswald is have more of a block type look to is making it ideal for Headers and Titles while Roboto is more rounded and ideal for website text.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
        -   The occupanying imagery to go with each feature is aimed to give the user a quick insite into what the feature is.
        -   On the community page all imagery used is from community members who want to show off their talents.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY

## Problems and Soultions

### Collapsable Menu on Mobile

One big hurdle I came across was figuring out how to make the navigation bar change to a clickable button which creates a dropdown menu for the navigation only on mobile devices. I knew this was possible using bootstrap but it took a while to figure out how to implement it.

The first step was to figure out how to make the navigation toggle button, which while in the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/) I used this code which worked as the navigation toggle button:

```
<nav class="navbar navbar-dark bg-dark">
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarToggleExternalContent" aria-controls="navbarToggleExternalContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
      <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
    </button>
  </div>
</nav>

```

Once adding this to the end of my header div I needed to add the **collapse** class and **navbarToggleExternalContent** id to the unordered list holding the navigation links.

The next obsticle was to figure out how to have the navigation toggle button only display on smaller screen, and to make the navigation bar only collapse when on smaller screens. 

For this I knew I would have to implement a media query is style.css to change the display property of the **navbar** to none, but my stuggle come from how to make it so that the navbar didn't collapse when in tablet or web view. I did some research using both the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) and this [Stack Overflow Post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74548965/bootstrap-5x-collapse-on-mobile-only) I found that I needed to add the following code in my media query to show all collapsed content on a big screen size

```
.collapse:not(.show) {
        display: block;
        visibility: visible;
    }

```

Once I had to functionality working I had to get the dropdown menu into the correct position, and to do this I made the width of **navbar-nav** to 45%, set the display of all the list items within the navbar to block so they now stack, and then moved the whole navbar to the right and gave it a top offset of 70px to sit just below the header div. Here is the code

```
.navbar-nav {
        width: 40%;
        margin: 0;
        padding:0;
        position: absolute;
        right: 0;
        top: 70px;
    }

    .nav-item {
        display: block;
        text-align: center;
        background-color: #A367B1;
        border: 1px solid white;
        line-height: 50%;
        width:100%;
    }
    
```
